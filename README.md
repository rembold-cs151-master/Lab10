# Lab 8: Palindromic Sentences

In this lab you'll look to write a few functions to help you determine whether a particular sentence or phrase is a palindrome if punctuation, whitespace, and capitalization is ignored.

I do have autotests running for this program, so you can can upload back to Github if you want to see if the autochecks pass. That said, you don't need to do so, as I'll be checking you off directly during class.
